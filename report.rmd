## Ligada Trial Analysis

This is a test trial for the Ligada Analysis.  

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r workers}
summary(workers$education_name)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r workers, echo=FALSE}
plot(workers$education_name, col="red",main="Education Level of Workers", xlab="Education Level", ylab="Number of People")```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
